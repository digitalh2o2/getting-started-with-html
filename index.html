    <h1>My notes for Stage 0</h1>
    <p>I have taken some previous courses regarding the basics of HTML
    but it was nice to see new tags that I have <b>not</b> seen before</p>
    
    <br>For example it was nice to see that <em>break</em> works just like 
    <em>paragraph</em> but falls under an <b>inline</b> tag rather than a
    <b>block</b> tag that paragraph falls under.
    
    <p>It was alos nice to see the difference between <b>span</b> and 
      <b>div</b> tags as I've only seen in previous material but never 
      defined. One of those courses was <a href="www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Plans for this course</h2>
    <p>I look forward to <em><b>learning</b></em> new material along 
    the way and see how far my potential <b>can</b> go!.</p>
